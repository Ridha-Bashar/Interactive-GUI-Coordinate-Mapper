# Interactive-GUI-Coordinate-Mapper
Coordinate Tool For C graphics librarey

## Project Overview
A productivity tool developed to simplify the design of Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) in engineering applications. It provides a real-time coordinate tracking system that replicates the exact resolution and mapping of standard graphics libraries.

## Functionality
While most GUI builders are heavy, this lightweight Python tool allows developers to click anywhere on a defined canvas to retrieve immediate (X, Y) coordinates. This is particularly useful for mapping touch areas on small embedded screens or designing custom layouts.

## Features
* **Real-time Event Handling:** Captures mouse clicks with high precision.
* **Coordinate Synchronization:** Matches the coordinate system of popular graphics libraries.
* **Productivity Boost:** Eliminates "trial and error" in UI element positioning.

## Tech Stack
* Python (pygame/Graphics Libraries).
